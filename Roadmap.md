## RDFa API ##

On June 8th, 2010 the W3C has issued a [first public working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-rdfa-api-20100608/) of the [RDFa API](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-api/). This draft was produced by Manu Sporny, Benjamin Adrian and Mark Birbeck, and much of the architecture is based on implementation experience from the backplanejs RDFa module. This means that it will be straightforward to bring the library into line with the spec.

The issue that will track progress is [issue 57](http://code.google.com/p/backplanejs/issues/detail?id=57). The milestone tag for collecting all features together is '[RDFaAPI-FPWD](http://code.google.com/p/backplanejs/issues/list?q=label:Milestone-RDFaAPI-FPWD)'.
