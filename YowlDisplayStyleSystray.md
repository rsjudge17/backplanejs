## Introduction ##

This display theme makes use of the system tray component, if available, to display notifications outside of the browser window.

## Requirements ##

Users will need to have installed the backplanejs System Tray component, available from the [download page](http://code.google.com/p/backplanejs/downloads/list). This currently only runs on Windows, but it can be accessed from both Internet Explorer and Firefox.

## Testing ##

Once installed, notifications can be directed to the system tray. Verify your installation using [this test](http://backplanejs.googlecode.com/hg/_samples/yowl/test-yowl-systray.html).
